# Hotel Reservation App
- Everything you see inside the Application written in pure Java and Designed by me.
- You can check out JavaDocs generated for documentation.

## Application Architecture
Applications architecture is also designed and written by me.

I used layering for code maintainability and to make it more human readable. The app will be separated into the following layers:

- User interface (UI), including a main menu for the users who want to book a room, and an admin menu for administrative functions.
- Resources will act as our Application Programming Interface (API) to our UI.
- Services will communicate with our resources, and each other, to build the business logic necessary to provide feedback to our UI.
- Data models will be used to represent the domain that we're using within the system (e.g., rooms, reservations, and customers).
